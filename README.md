# pk12_GoGo_Boards
n this session, participants will be introduced to the GoGo Board and logo programming language. They will learn to setup the board, use sensors and actuators, and write simple procedures using loops and logic commands. They will also learn to set up experiments collecting and retrieving data of sensors. The GoGo board is a low-cost open-source hardware device for educational robotics, scientific experiments, and environmental sensing. People can use the board to construct robots, measure and log environmental data, conduct scientific investigations, create game controllers, build interactive art installations, and much more.
